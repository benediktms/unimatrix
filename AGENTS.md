# unimatrix

A modular, symlink-friendly agent framework for Claude Code.

## Structure

- `agents/` — Agent definitions (markdown + YAML frontmatter)
- `skills/` — Slash command skills (`/assemble`, `/start-work`, `/comply`)
- `rules/` — Routing and coordination rules
- `hooks/` — Event hooks for Claude Code (token tracking, compaction warnings, subagent tracking)
- `install.sh` — Symlink installer (global or per-project)

## Installation

```bash
# Global (all projects)
./install.sh --global

# Per-project
./install.sh --project ~/code/my-project
```

## Agents

| Agent | Model | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| queen | Opus | Strategic mind — plans, orchestrates, dispatches drones |
| drone | Sonnet | Worker — implements a single well-defined step |
| vinculum | Opus | Reviewer — validates correctness and quality with evidence-based verification |
| probe | Sonnet | Scout — codebase search and reconnaissance |
| cortex | Opus | Analyst — deep architectural audits, security reviews, and codebase health assessments |
| subroutine | Haiku | Housekeeping — git commits, docs, brain task management |

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/analyse` | Deep analysis — feature review, plan validation, architectural audits |
| `/assemble` | Assemble the collective — plan, decide dispatch strategy, execute, and review |
| `/start-work` | Resume execution of a previously planned epic |
| `/comply` | Validate changes via vinculum agent. You will comply. |
| `/swarm` | Partition files and dispatch parallel drones for bulk changes |
| `/adapt` | Iterative refinement loop — drone implements, vinculum reviews, repeat until pass |
| `/assimilate` | End-of-session knowledge capture and cleanup ritual |

## Git Conventions

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). All commit messages **must** follow this format:

```
<type>: <description>
```

### Types

| Type | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature or capability |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `chore` | Maintenance, deps, config, tooling |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace (no code change) |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |

### Rules

- **Lowercase** type and description (e.g., `feat: add session greeting hook`)
- **No scope** — keep it simple, scopes are not used in this project
- **Imperative mood** in description ("add", not "added" or "adds")
- Body is optional — use it for multi-line explanations when the "why" isn't obvious from the title
- When making changes that affect documented surface area, **update AGENTS.md in the same commit**

## Task Management

This project uses `brain` for task tracking. **Always use MCP tools for task operations** — they provide structured responses and are the canonical interface for AI agents. CLI commands exist for human terminal use only.

### MCP Tools (preferred for AI agents)

When running as an MCP server (`brain mcp`), these tools are available:

**Task tools:**
- `tasks_apply_event` — Single tool for all task mutations. Event types: `task_created`, `task_updated`, `status_changed`, `dependency_added`, `dependency_removed`, `comment_added`, `label_added`, `label_removed`, `note_linked`, `note_unlinked`, `parent_set`. Accepts task ID as full ID or unique prefix (e.g. `BRN-01JPH`).
- `tasks_list` — List tasks filtered by status: `open` (default, excludes done), `ready` (no unresolved deps), `blocked` (has unresolved deps), `done`. Supports `task_ids` array for batch lookup, `limit` for pagination, `include_description` flag, and per-field filters: `priority` (0-4), `task_type`, `assignee`, `label`, `search` (FTS5 full-text search on title+description).
- `tasks_get` — Get full task details including relationships, comments, labels, and linked notes. Use `expand` parameter (`parent`, `children`, `blocked_by`, `blocks`) to inline related task objects.
- `tasks_next` — Get highest-priority ready tasks sorted by priority then due date. Use for "what should I work on?" queries.
- `tasks_close` — Close one or more tasks by ID/prefix. Accepts a single string or array of task IDs. Returns closed tasks and newly unblocked task IDs.
- `tasks_labels_summary` — Get all unique labels with counts and associated task IDs (short prefixes). No parameters. Use for label discovery and taxonomy overview.
- `tasks_labels_batch` — Batch label operations. Actions: `add` (label + task_ids), `remove` (label + task_ids), `rename` (old_label + new_label), `purge` (label). Returns succeeded/failed/summary.
- `tasks_deps_batch` — Batch dependency operations. Actions: `add`/`remove` (pairs of task_id + depends_on_task_id), `chain` (ordered task_ids), `fan` (source_task_id + dependent_task_ids), `clear` (task_id). Returns succeeded/failed/summary.

**Memory tools:**
- `memory_search_minimal` — Semantic search across indexed notes. Returns compact stubs (title, summary, score). Use `intent` parameter to control ranking: `lookup` (keyword-heavy), `planning` (recency + links), `reflection` (recency-heavy), `synthesis` (vector-heavy). Optional `tags` array boosts results matching the given tags via Jaccard similarity (e.g. `["rust", "memory"]`).
- `memory_expand` — Expand stubs from `search_minimal` to full content by chunk ID. Use `budget` to control token limit. Returns `byte_start`/`byte_end` offsets within the source file for each chunk.
- `memory_write_episode` — Record structured episodes (goal, actions, outcome) with tags and importance score.
- `memory_reflect` — Retrieve source material for a topic, suitable for reflection and synthesis.

### CLI Commands (for human terminal use)

```bash
# Finding work
brain tasks ready              # Show tasks with no blockers
brain tasks list               # List all tasks
brain tasks list --status=open # Filter by status
brain tasks list --search "query" # Full-text search
brain tasks list --priority 1 --label urgent # Combined filters
brain tasks show <id>          # Detailed task view

# Creating & updating
brain tasks create --title="..." --description="..." --type=task --priority=2
brain tasks update <id> --status=in_progress
brain tasks comment <id> "comment text"

# Dependencies
brain tasks dep add <task> <depends-on>
brain tasks dep add-chain BRN-01 BRN-02 BRN-03  # Sequential chain
brain tasks dep add-fan BRN-01 BRN-02,BRN-03    # Fan-out from source
brain tasks dep clear BRN-01                      # Remove all deps

# Labels
brain tasks labels                    # List all labels with counts
brain tasks list --group-by label     # List tasks grouped by label
brain tasks label batch-add --tasks BRN-01,BRN-02 my-label
brain tasks label rename old-label new-label
brain tasks label purge old-label

# Completing work
brain tasks close <id1> <id2>  # Close one or more tasks
brain tasks stats              # Project statistics

# Agent docs
brain docs                     # Regenerate AGENTS.md + bridge CLAUDE.md
brain agent schema             # Output JSON Schema for all MCP tools
brain agent schema --pretty    # Pretty-printed output
brain agent schema --tool tasks.apply_event --pretty  # Single tool
```

> **Tip:** Run `brain agent schema --pretty` to get the full JSON Schema for all MCP tools, including exact per-event-type payload definitions for `tasks_apply_event`. This is useful for validating payloads before sending them.

### Finding Work

When the user asks what to work on next (e.g., "what's next?", "what should I work on?", "next task", "any work?"), always check brain tasks first:
1. Use `tasks_next` MCP tool to get unblocked tasks sorted by priority
2. Present the top candidates with their ID, title, priority, and type
3. If a task has dependencies, briefly note what's blocking it

### Workflow

When working on tasks:
1. **Before starting**: Mark the task `in_progress` via `tasks_apply_event` (status_changed)
2. **While working**: Add comments via `tasks_apply_event` (comment_added) for significant decisions or blockers
3. **On completion**: Close the task via `tasks_close` (or `tasks_apply_event` with status_changed to `done`)

**Assignee**: Borg agents (queen, drone, vinculum, subroutine) use their agent name as the assignee — this is defined in their agent definitions. If you are the lead session (not a named Borg agent), set the assignee to the current Git user name (`git config user.name`).

**Cross-task insights**: If you discover during work on one task that something affects or should be captured on a different task, immediately add a comment to that task with the relevant context. Don't defer — the insight is freshest now and costs seconds to capture vs. minutes to reconstruct later.

**Planning references**: When planning work, always reference the task ID(s) being planned for and any related tasks that may be affected. This creates a traceable link between plans and the work they address, and helps future agents (or humans) understand why decisions were made.

### Conventions

- **Priority scale**: 0=critical, 1=high, 2=medium, 3=low, 4=backlog
- **Task types**: task, bug, feature, epic, spike
- **Statuses**: open, in_progress, blocked, done, cancelled
