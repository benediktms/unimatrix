# Unimatrix

A multi-agent orchestration framework for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) that coordinates specialized AI agents to plan, implement, review, and analyze software engineering tasks.

Unimatrix extends both platforms with a collective of agents — each with a distinct role, model, and set of capabilities — orchestrated through slash commands, event hooks, and persistent task tracking via [Brain](https://github.com/benediktms/brain).

## How It Works

Unimatrix follows a plan-execute-review cycle:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Plan["Lead<br/>plans"] --> Execute["Drones<br/>build"] --> Review["Vinculum<br/>reviews"] --> Cleanup["Subroutine<br/>cleans up"]
    Review -->|NEEDS_CHANGES| Execute
```

1. **The lead session plans** — decomposes a task into subtasks, sets dependencies, and produces a dispatch plan (the lead session directly in Claude Code, the BorgQueen agent in OpenCode)
2. **The lead session dispatches** — spawns Drones (and optionally Probes/Cortex) to carry out the plan
3. **Drones implement** — each executes a single well-scoped task, commits changes, and saves a checkpoint
4. **The Vinculum reviews** — validates correctness with evidence-based verification
5. **The Subroutine cleans up** — commits, closes tasks, writes memory episodes

All task state, checkpoints, and learned patterns are persisted in Brain, enabling work to be resumed across sessions.

### Agents

| Agent | Model | Platform | Role |
|-------|-------|----------|------|
| **Lead / BorgQueen** | Opus | Both | Plans, dispatches, and orchestrates — the lead session itself in Claude Code, the BorgQueen agent in OpenCode |
| **Drone** | Sonnet | Both | Implementation worker — executes a single well-scoped brain task, commits changes, saves checkpoints |
| **Vinculum** | Opus | Both | Code reviewer — evidence-based verification with tiered reviews (Quick/Standard/Deep) and verdicts (PASS/NEEDS_CHANGES/BLOCK) |
| **Probe** | Sonnet | Both | Codebase scout — finds files, traces code paths, answers structural questions. Fast and shallow |
| **Cortex** | Opus | Both | Deep analyst — architectural audits, security reviews, performance analysis, codebase health. Slow and thorough |
| **Subroutine** | Haiku | Both | Cleanup worker — git commits, documentation sync, brain task closure. Executes explicit instructions only |

Agent definitions live in `src/agents/` as markdown files with combined YAML frontmatter that configures platform-specific model, permission mode, max turns, and allowed/disallowed tools. See [FORMAT.md](./FORMAT.md) for the combined source format.

### Skills (Slash Commands)

Skills are the primary interface for invoking workflows:

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/assemble` | End-to-end orchestration: lead plans, Drones implement (parallel or sequential waves), Vinculum reviews |
| `/recon` | Reconnaissance and feature planning: recon team self-claims brain tasks, shares discoveries in real-time. `--plan` for iterative feature scoping |
| `/adapt` | Iterative refinement loop: Drone implements, Vinculum reviews, repeat until PASS (default 3 cycles, max 5) |
| `/swarm` | Bulk parallel changes: lead partitions files into groups (max 5), Drones work in parallel on non-overlapping partitions |
| `/comply` | Code review: invokes Vinculum on uncommitted changes, a branch, a file path, or a brain task |
| `/analyse` | Deep analysis: invokes Cortex for architectural audits, security reviews, or codebase health assessments |
| `/diagnose` | Adversarial hypothesis testing: Vinculum team investigates competing theories, converges on root cause. `--fix` to implement |
| `/reengage` | Resume a previously planned brain task |
| `/assimilate` | End-of-session ritual: captures knowledge, writes memory episodes, prepares context for next session |
| `/harvest` | Session knowledge extraction: Probe-style scan of exploration findings, Cortex deduplicates and persists as brain records/memory |
| `/bisect` | Guided binary search through commits: automated (`--test`) or AI-guided with Probe analysis, runs in worktree |
| `/bookmark` | Save a named checkpoint of current work state — branch, tasks, changes, next steps — for later resumption |
| `/resume` | Restore context from a saved bookmark: staleness detection, task status diff, structured briefing |
| `/designate` | Generates Borg-style agent designations (e.g., "Seven of Nine, Septenary Tactical Adjunct of Trimatrix 712") |
| `/status` | Displays session status — active agents, elapsed time, cost, and compaction count |

Skill definitions live in `src/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

## Build System

Unimatrix uses a single set of source files in `src/` to generate platform-specific output for both Claude Code and OpenCode. The build system (`build.py`) processes combined YAML frontmatter and conditional body sections to produce the correct output per platform.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Src["src/<br/>agents, skills,<br/>rules, hooks"] --> Build["build.py<br/>validate → merge<br/>frontmatter → strip<br/>conditionals"]
    Build --> Claude["dist/claude-code/<br/>.claude/agents<br/>.claude/skills<br/>.claude/rules"]
    Build --> OC["dist/opencode/<br/>.opencode/agents<br/>.claude/skills<br/>themes/<br/>tui.json"]
```

Source files use:
- **Combined frontmatter** — shared fields at the top level, platform-specific overrides in `claude:` / `opencode:` sections
- **Conditional body sections** — `<!-- @claude -->` ... `<!-- @end -->` and `<!-- @opencode -->` ... `<!-- @end -->` markers for platform-specific content
- **Platform filtering** — `platforms: [claude]` or `platforms: [opencode]` to restrict a file to one platform

See [FORMAT.md](./FORMAT.md) for the complete source format specification.

### Build Commands

```bash
python3 build.py --target all           # Build for both platforms (default)
python3 build.py --target claude        # Build for Claude Code only
python3 build.py --target opencode      # Build for OpenCode only
python3 build.py --validate             # Validate source files only
python3 build.py --clean                # Remove dist/ directory
python3 build.py --inject-tone [BRAIN]  # Inject Borg personality into a brain's AGENTS.md
```

Or use the [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner:

```bash
just build                # Build for both platforms
just build-claude         # Build for Claude Code only
just build-opencode       # Build for OpenCode only
just validate             # Validate source files
just check                # Run all checks (Python lint + TS type-check + validation)
just install-global       # Build + install both platforms globally
just install <path>       # Build + install both platforms to a project
just inject <brain-name>  # Inject Borg personality into a brain's AGENTS.md
```

### Personality Injection

Unimatrix maintains a single source-of-truth personality guide (`src/rules/personality.md`) that all agents follow. To propagate this personality into registered brains' documentation:

```bash
python3 build.py --inject-tone <brain-name>
just inject <brain-name>
```

The injector:
- Discovers registered brains via `brain list --json`
- Locates or creates `<!-- unimatrix:tone:start -->` / `<!-- unimatrix:tone:end -->` markers in the brain's AGENTS.md
- Replaces the marked section with the current personality guidelines from `src/rules/personality.md`
- Skips the unimatrix brain itself (prevents self-injection)
- Idempotent — safe to run repeatedly

This ensures all projects using Unimatrix have consistent, up-to-date personality guidance for their AI agents.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and/or [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai)
- [Brain](https://github.com/benediktms/brain) — task tracking, memory, and artifact persistence
- Python 3.12+ (for build system and hooks)
- [Deno](https://deno.com) (for OpenCode hook type-checking, optional)

### Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/benediktms/unimatrix.git

# Set up dependencies
just setup                # or: python3 -m venv .venv && pip install -e .

# Build and install globally for both platforms
just install-global

# Or install per-platform
./install.sh --claude --global
./install.sh --opencode --global

# Per-project installation
./install.sh --claude --project ~/code/my-project
./install.sh --opencode --project ~/code/my-project
./install.sh --both --project ~/code/my-project
```

The installer:
- Runs `build.py` if `dist/` is missing or stale
- Symlinks `agents/`, `rules/`, and `skills/` into the target config directory
- Merges Unimatrix settings (spinner verbs, status line, hooks) into your `settings.json` (Claude Code)
- Configures `core.hooksPath` for git hooks (Claude Code)
- Symlinks OpenCode hook plugins into `.opencode/plugins/`
- Installs Borg TUI theme to `~/.config/opencode/themes/` and TUI config to `~/.config/opencode/tui.json` (OpenCode global only)
- Backs up existing files before overwriting
- Cleans up stale symlinks from previous installs
- Skips project-level `.claude/skills/` when installing OpenCode to the unimatrix repo itself (if Claude Code skills are already installed globally) to prevent duplicate skills

Restart your editor/CLI after installation to pick up changes.

## Workflows

### `/assemble` — Full Orchestration

The primary workflow for complex, multi-step tasks:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Request([User request])
    Request --> Assess

    Assess["Lead assesses"]
    Assess -->|RECON_NEEDED| Recon["Probes / Cortex investigate"]
    Assess -->|SKIP_RECON| Plan

    Recon --> Plan["Lead plans<br/><i>dispatch plan with waves + dependencies</i>"]

    Plan --> Wave1

    subgraph Wave1 ["Wave 1 (parallel)"]
        DroneA["Drone A — files: a, b"]
        DroneB["Drone B — files: c, d"]
    end

    Wave1 -->|checkpoints passed forward| Wave2

    subgraph Wave2 ["Wave 2 (sequential)"]
        DroneC["Drone C — integration"]
    end

    Wave2 --> Review["Vinculum reviews"]
    Review -->|PASS| Done([Done])
    Review -->|NEEDS_CHANGES| Fix["Dispatch fix Drones"]
    Review -->|BLOCK| Escalate([Escalate to user])
    Fix --> Review
```

### `/adapt` — Iterative Refinement

For tasks that need multiple passes to converge:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Drone["Drone<br/>builds"] --> Vinculum["Vinculum<br/>reviews"]
    Vinculum -->|PASS| Done([Done])
    Vinculum -->|NEEDS_CHANGES<br/>feedback| Drone
    Vinculum -->|BLOCK| Escalate([Escalate])
```

### `/swarm` — Parallel Bulk Changes

For applying the same kind of change across many files:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Lead["Lead partitions files<br/>into non-overlapping groups"] --> Drone1 & Drone2 & Drone3
    Drone1["Drone 1<br/><code>src/components/*.tsx</code>"]
    Drone2["Drone 2<br/><code>src/hooks/*.ts</code>"]
    Drone3["Drone 3<br/><code>src/utils/*.ts</code>"]
    Drone1 & Drone2 & Drone3 --> Review["Vinculum reviews<br/>aggregate changes"]
```

### `/recon` — Reconnaissance

For understanding a codebase area before making changes:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Lead["Lead scopes investigation"] --> ProbeA & ProbeB & Cortex
    ProbeA["Probe A<br/>trace auth flow"]
    ProbeB["Probe B<br/>find all API endpoints"]
    Cortex["Cortex<br/>audit security posture"]
    ProbeA & ProbeB & Cortex -->|results linked to brain tasks| Synthesis["Synthesized findings<br/>returned to user"]
```

## Brain Integration

[Brain](https://github.com/benediktms/brain) is the persistence layer that enables coordination across agents and sessions. Unimatrix uses Brain for three core functions:

### Task Management

Brain tracks all work as tasks with dependencies, priorities, and status:

```
Epic: "Implement auth system"
├── Task 1: "Add JWT middleware" (ready)
├── Task 2: "Create login endpoint" (blocked by 1)
├── Task 3: "Add session store" (blocked by 1)
└── Task 4: "Integration tests" (blocked by 2, 3)
```

- The **lead session** creates epics and subtasks with dependencies via `tasks_apply_event`
- **Drones** mark tasks `in_progress`, add comments, and report completion
- `tasks_next` returns the highest-priority unblocked tasks
- `tasks_close` closes completed tasks and unblocks dependents

### Snapshots and Artifacts

Brain stores checkpoints and artifacts that enable context flow between agents:

| What | Who Creates | Purpose | Tags |
|------|-------------|---------|------|
| Drone checkpoints | Drone | Pass context to subsequent waves | `drone-checkpoint`, `parent:<task-id>` |
| Implementation artifacts | Drone | Permanent record of what changed | `drone-implementation` |
| Lead plans | Lead | Plan record before execution | `queen-plan` |
| Probe findings | Probe | Recon results linked to tasks | `probe-recon` |
| Cortex analyses | Cortex | Structured analysis reports | `cortex-analysis` |
| Vinculum reviews | Vinculum | Review verdicts and evidence | `vinculum-review` |

**Cross-wave context flow:** When Drones in Wave 1 complete, the lead extracts their snapshot IDs and passes them to Wave 2 Drones via `PRIOR CHECKPOINTS: <id1>, <id2>` in the prompt. This enables context handoff without the lead relaying full file contents.

### Memory

Brain's semantic memory enables knowledge persistence across sessions:

- `memory_write_episode` — Records structured episodes (goal, actions, outcome) with tags and importance
- `memory_search_minimal` — Semantic search with intent-aware ranking (lookup, planning, reflection, synthesis)
- `memory_expand` — Fetches full content from search stubs

The auto-learner system (see Hooks below) uses memory to capture and replay error/fix patterns automatically.

## Hooks

Unimatrix hooks into platform event systems for automatic state management. Claude Code hooks are Python scripts in `src/hooks/claude/`. OpenCode hooks are TypeScript plugins in `src/hooks/opencode/`. Both implementations follow the shared logic defined in `src/hooks/SPEC.md`.

### State Tracking

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `track-agents.py` | SubagentStart/Stop | Tracks active subagents per session (type, duration, count) |
| `track-cost.py` | SubagentStop | Parses transcripts for token usage, calculates cost per agent tier |
| `track-compactions.py` | PreCompact | Counts context window compactions per session |

### Compaction Management

Claude Code compacts (summarizes) the conversation when the context window fills up. Unimatrix preserves critical state across compactions:

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `checkpoint-state.py` | PreCompact | Captures open tasks, active agents, and costs; saves as brain snapshot and temp file |
| `inject-checkpoint.py` | UserPromptSubmit | Injects the saved checkpoint into the next prompt after compaction (one-shot) |
| `warn-compaction.py` | PostToolUse | Estimates token usage and warns at 70%/85% thresholds before compaction hits |

### Auto-Learner

The auto-learner captures error/fix patterns and replays them in future sessions:

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `learner-track.py` | PostToolUse | Detects tool failures, then watches for successful follow-ups. Scores error/fix pairs and persists high-confidence patterns to brain memory |
| `learner-inject.py` | UserPromptSubmit | Searches brain for auto-learned patterns matching pending errors, injects matching fixes as context |

### Other

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `post-commit` | Git post-commit | Re-runs `install.sh --global` to keep symlinks in sync after changes |

### Status Line

`src/shared/statusline.py` renders a custom Claude Code status line showing active agents (color-coded by type), elapsed durations, compaction count, and session cost.

## Coordination Patterns

### Parallel Execution

When plan steps are independent, multiple Drones run simultaneously:

- **File-partitioned:** Each Drone gets a non-overlapping set of files. No worktree isolation needed — all commit directly to the current branch.
- **Worktree-isolated:** When Drones might touch overlapping files, each runs in an isolated git worktree. The lead squash-merges branches between waves.

### Sequential Execution

When steps have dependencies, Drones run one at a time. Prior checkpoint IDs flow forward via `PRIOR CHECKPOINTS:` in the prompt.

### Sequence Relay

For long sequential chains (3+ steps), each Drone saves a handoff snapshot and the next Drone receives only the handoff as prior context — avoiding lead session compaction in long chains.

### Mixed-Mode

Most real plans mix both: parallel foundation waves, sequential integration steps, parallel finishing work. The lead's dispatch plan specifies the wave structure.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Wave1 ["Wave 1 — Parallel (foundation)"]
        D1["Drone 1"] & D2["Drone 2"] & D3["Drone 3"]
    end
    subgraph Wave2 ["Wave 2 — Sequential (integration)"]
        D4["Drone 4"] --> D5["Drone 5"]
    end
    subgraph Wave3 ["Wave 3 — Parallel (finishing)"]
        D6["Drone 6"] & D7["Drone 7"]
    end
    Wave1 -->|checkpoints| Wave2 -->|checkpoints| Wave3
```

### Error Handling

- If a Drone fails, it marks the task `blocked` and reports to the lead
- The lead does not retry with the same approach — it escalates to the user
- If the Vinculum finds critical issues, the lead dispatches new Drones with specific fix instructions

## Themes

Unimatrix ships 5 Borg-aesthetic TUI themes for OpenCode. Themes are installed to `~/.config/opencode/themes/` during global installation.

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `unimatrix` | Borg green-on-dark — the default collective aesthetic |
| `unimatrix-zero` | Soft dreamlike greens — Unimatrix Zero's subconscious drift |
| `queens-chamber` | Deep purple/violet — the Queen's sovereign aesthetic |
| `tactical-cube` | Aggressive red-shifted — crimson plasma of the combat cube |
| `unicomplex` | Gold/amber — the warm glow of the central hub |

To switch themes, edit `src/tui/tui.json` and change the `"theme"` value to any of the names above, then rebuild:

```bash
just build
# or install directly
./install.sh --opencode --global
```

## Configuration

### `settings.json`

Merged into Claude Code's settings during installation. Configures:

- **Hooks** — Maps Claude Code events to hook scripts (`SubagentStart/Stop`, `PreCompact`, `PostToolUse`, `UserPromptSubmit`)
- **Spinner verbs** — Custom Borg-themed loading messages
- **Status line** — Points to `statusline.py` for the custom status bar

### Agent Definitions

Each agent file (`src/agents/*.md`) uses combined YAML frontmatter with shared and platform-specific sections:

```yaml
---
model: sonnet
description: "Worker agent — implements a single well-defined task"

claude:
  name: Drone
  permissionMode: bypassPermissions
  disallowedTools: [Agent]
  maxTurns: 50

opencode:
  mode: subagent
  steps: 50
  permission:
    "*": allow
  tools:
    task: false
---
```

### Skill Definitions

Each skill file (`src/skills/*/SKILL.md`) uses YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: "Short description shown in /help"
user_invocable: true
---
```
