# Unimatrix

A multi-agent orchestration framework for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) that coordinates specialized AI agents to plan, implement, review, and analyze software engineering tasks. The project is distinctly **Star Trek Borg-themed** — agents are adjuncts of the collective, the lead session is the Borg Queen, and all terminology (assimilation, compliance, regeneration alcoves, etc.) reflects that aesthetic.

Unimatrix extends both platforms with a collective of agents — each with a distinct role, model, and set of capabilities — orchestrated through `/trimatrix`, event hooks, and persistent task tracking via [Brain](https://github.com/benediktms/brain).

## How It Works

Unimatrix follows a plan-execute-review cycle orchestrated by the trimatrix supergraph:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Plan["Lead<br/>plans"] --> Execute["Assimilation Adjuncts<br/>build"] --> Review["Validation Adjunct<br/>reviews"] --> Cleanup["Closure Adjunct<br/>cleans up"]
    Review -->|NEEDS_CHANGES| Execute
```

1. **The lead session plans** — classifies intent, decomposes into a graph of subtasks with dependencies, and computes execution waves
2. **The lead session dispatches** — spawns Assimilation Adjuncts (and optionally Reconnaissance/Tactical Analysis Adjuncts) per wave
3. **Assimilation Adjuncts implement** — each executes a single well-scoped task, commits changes, and saves a checkpoint
4. **The Validation Adjunct reviews** — validates correctness with evidence-based verification
5. **The Closure Adjunct cleans up** — commits, closes tasks, writes memory episodes

All task state, checkpoints, and learned patterns are persisted in Brain, enabling work to be resumed across sessions.

### Agents

| Agent | Protocol | Model | Platform | Role |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|------|
| **Lead Session** | (direct) | Opus | Claude Code | Plans, dispatches, and orchestrates — the lead session itself |
| **Queen** | `queen-coordination-protocol` | Opus | OpenCode | Lead agent in OpenCode — strategic mind + direct execution |
| **Assimilation Adjunct** | `adjunct-assimilation-protocol` | Sonnet | Both | Implementation worker — executes a single well-scoped brain task, commits changes, saves checkpoints |
| **Validation Adjunct** | `adjunct-validation-protocol` | Opus | Both | Code reviewer — evidence-based verification with tiered reviews and verdicts (PASS/NEEDS_CHANGES/BLOCK) |
| **Reconnaissance Adjunct** | `adjunct-reconnaissance-protocol` | Sonnet | Both | Codebase scout — finds files, traces code paths, answers structural questions. Fast and shallow |
| **Tactical Analysis Adjunct** | `adjunct-tactical-analysis-protocol` | Opus | Both | Deep analyst — architectural audits, security reviews, performance analysis, codebase health. Slow and thorough |
| **Closure Adjunct** | `adjunct-closure-protocol` | Haiku | Both | Cleanup worker — git commits, documentation sync, brain task closure. Executes explicit instructions only |

Agent definitions live in `src/agents/` as markdown files with combined YAML frontmatter that configures platform-specific model, permission mode, max turns, and allowed/disallowed tools. See [FORMAT.md](./FORMAT.md) for the combined source format.

### Trimatrix Supergraph

All orchestration routes through a single unified skill: `/trimatrix`. Every prompt is classified by **intent** and **complexity tier**, then dispatched to the appropriate execution mode.

**Intents:**

| Intent | Triggers | Modes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| IMPLEMENT | Code changes, new features, refactoring | `plan-execute`, `adapt`, `swarm` |
| INVESTIGATE | "How does X work", "find Y", architectural questions | `investigate` |
| DIAGNOSE | Bug reports, "why does X happen" | `diagnose` |
| ARCHITECT | "Evaluate approaches for X", design decisions | `architect` |
| REVIEW | Code review requests, validation | `review` |
| REFACTOR | Structural cleanup, rename operations | `plan-execute`, `swarm` |
| RESUME | Continue prior work | Restores checkpoint, routes to original mode |

**Tiers:**

| Tier | Complexity | Strategy |
|------|-----------|----------|
| T1 | 1-2 files, clear spec | SELF — lead executes directly |
| T2 | 3-8 files, moderate | INDEPENDENT — adjuncts work in parallel |
| T3 | 9+ files, cross-cutting | COORDINATED — adjuncts + team coordination |

**Modes:**

| Mode | Legacy Alias | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `plan-execute` | `/assemble` | Multi-file implementation with worktree isolation, wave dispatch, recon, review |
| `investigate` | `/recon`, `/analyse` | Collaborative, independent, or deep investigation sub-modes |
| `diagnose` | `/diagnose` | Adversarial hypothesis testing via Validation Adjunct team. `--fix` to implement |
| `architect` | (new) | Adversarial architecture evaluation. `--execute` hands winner to plan-execute |
| `review` | `/comply` | Code review — single adjunct or compliance matrix (`--matrix`) |
| `adapt` | `/adapt` | Iterative implement-review loop until PASS (`--cycles N`, default 3, max 5) |
| `swarm` | `/swarm` | File-partitioned bulk changes, max 5 partitions |
| `cross-repo` | (new) | Multi-repository feature execution with merge gates and per-node worktrees |

### Trimatrix MCP Server

The graph engine runs as an MCP server (`bin/unimatrix`), compiled from TypeScript source in `src/skills/trimatrix/`. It exposes 30 tools for graph lifecycle, node management, wave dispatch, checkpoint persistence, and agent designation generation.

Key tools: `init`, `add_node`, `add_edge`, `compute_waves`, `dispatch_wave`, `complete_node`, `save_checkpoint`, `restore_checkpoint`, `designate`, `status`.

The server is auto-compiled during installation via `just compile` (Deno compile → `bin/unimatrix`).

## Build System

Unimatrix uses a single set of source files in `src/` to generate platform-specific output for both Claude Code and OpenCode. The build system (`build.py`) processes combined YAML frontmatter and conditional body sections to produce the correct output per platform.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Src["src/<br/>agents, skills,<br/>rules, hooks"] --> Build["build.py<br/>validate → merge<br/>frontmatter → strip<br/>conditionals"]
    Build --> Claude["dist/claude-code/<br/>.claude/agents<br/>.claude/skills<br/>.claude/rules"]
    Build --> OC["dist/opencode/<br/>.opencode/agents<br/>.claude/skills<br/>themes/<br/>tui.json"]
    Src --> Compile["deno compile<br/>server.ts"]
    Compile --> Bin["bin/unimatrix<br/>(MCP server)"]
```

Source files use:
- **Combined frontmatter** — shared fields at the top level, platform-specific overrides in `claude:` / `opencode:` sections
- **Conditional body sections** — `<!-- @claude -->` ... `<!-- @end -->` and `<!-- @opencode -->` ... `<!-- @end -->` markers for platform-specific content
- **Platform filtering** — `platforms: [claude]` or `platforms: [opencode]` to restrict a file to one platform

See [FORMAT.md](./FORMAT.md) for the complete source format specification.

### Build Commands

```bash
python3 build.py --target all           # Build for both platforms (default)
python3 build.py --target claude        # Build for Claude Code only
python3 build.py --target opencode      # Build for OpenCode only
python3 build.py --validate             # Validate source files only
python3 build.py --clean                # Remove dist/ directory
python3 build.py --inject-tone [BRAIN]  # Inject Borg personality into a brain's AGENTS.md
```

Or use the [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner:

```bash
just build                # Build for both platforms
just build-claude         # Build for Claude Code only
just build-opencode       # Build for OpenCode only
just compile              # Compile the unimatrix MCP server binary
just validate             # Validate source files
just check                # Run all checks (Python lint + TS type-check + validation)
just check-py             # Lint Python files only
just check-ts             # Type-check OpenCode hook plugin only
just setup                # Install all dependencies (Python venv + Deno cache)
just venv                 # Create/refresh Python virtual environment
just install-global       # Build + compile + install both platforms globally
just install [path]       # Build + compile + install both platforms to a project
just install-claude [path]  # Build + compile + install Claude Code to a project
just install-opencode [path]  # Build + compile + install OpenCode to a project
just inject <brain-name>  # Inject Borg personality into a brain's AGENTS.md
just clean                # Remove dist/ directory
just clean-all            # Remove dist/ + .venv/
```

### Personality Injection

Unimatrix maintains a single source-of-truth personality guide (`src/rules/personality.md`) that all agents follow. To propagate this personality into registered brains' documentation:

```bash
python3 build.py --inject-tone <brain-name>   # Single brain
python3 build.py --inject-tone               # All registered brains
just inject <brain-name>
```

The injector:
- Discovers registered brains via `brain list --json`
- Locates or creates `<!-- unimatrix:tone:start -->` / `<!-- unimatrix:tone:end -->` markers in the brain's AGENTS.md
- Replaces the marked section with the current personality guidelines from `src/rules/personality.md`
- Skips the unimatrix brain itself (prevents self-injection)
- Idempotent — safe to run repeatedly

This ensures all projects using Unimatrix have consistent, up-to-date personality guidance for their AI agents.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and/or [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai)
- [Brain](https://github.com/benediktms/brain) — task tracking, memory, and artifact persistence
- Python 3.12+ (for build system and hooks)
- [Deno](https://deno.com) (for MCP server compilation and OpenCode hook type-checking)

### Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/benediktms/unimatrix.git

# Set up dependencies
just setup                # or: python3 -m venv .venv && pip install -e . && deno install

# Build and install globally for both platforms
just install-global

# Or install per-platform
./install.sh --claude --global
./install.sh --opencode --global

# Per-project installation
./install.sh --claude --project ~/code/my-project
./install.sh --opencode --project ~/code/my-project
./install.sh --both --project ~/code/my-project
```

The installer:
- Runs `build.py` if `dist/` is missing or stale
- Compiles the trimatrix MCP server (`src/skills/trimatrix/server.ts` → `bin/unimatrix`) if missing or stale
- Symlinks `bin/unimatrix` to `~/bin/unimatrix`
- Symlinks `agents/` and `rules/` into the target config directory
- Symlinks individual skill subdirectories (preserves pre-existing skills in the target)
- Registers the unimatrix MCP server via `claude mcp add` (Claude Code only, idempotent)
- Merges Unimatrix settings (spinner verbs, status line, hooks) into your `settings.json` (Claude Code)
- Configures `core.hooksPath` for git hooks (Claude Code, unimatrix repo only)
- Symlinks OpenCode hook plugins into `.opencode/plugins/`
- Installs Borg TUI theme to `~/.config/opencode/themes/` and TUI config to `~/.config/opencode/tui.json` (OpenCode global only)
- Backs up existing files before overwriting
- Cleans up stale symlinks from previous installs
- Skips project-level `.claude/skills/` when installing OpenCode to the unimatrix repo itself (if Claude Code skills are already installed globally) to prevent duplicate skills

Restart your editor/CLI after installation to pick up changes.

## Workflows

All workflows route through `/trimatrix`. The intent classifier determines the mode automatically based on the prompt.

### Plan-Execute

The primary workflow for complex, multi-step tasks:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Request([User request])
    Request --> Classify

    Classify["Trimatrix classifies<br/>intent + tier"]
    Classify -->|RECON_NEEDED| Recon["Reconnaissance Adjuncts<br/>investigate"]
    Classify -->|SKIP_RECON| Plan

    Recon --> Plan["Lead plans<br/><i>graph with waves + dependencies</i>"]

    Plan --> Wave1

    subgraph Wave1 ["Wave 1 (parallel)"]
        AdjA["Assimilation A — files: a, b"]
        AdjB["Assimilation B — files: c, d"]
    end

    Wave1 -->|checkpoints passed forward| Wave2

    subgraph Wave2 ["Wave 2 (sequential)"]
        AdjC["Assimilation C — integration"]
    end

    Wave2 --> Review["Validation Adjunct reviews"]
    Review -->|PASS| Done([Done])
    Review -->|NEEDS_CHANGES| Fix["Dispatch fix adjuncts"]
    Review -->|BLOCK| Escalate([Escalate to user])
    Fix --> Review
```

### Adapt

For tasks that need multiple passes to converge:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Adj["Assimilation<br/>builds"] --> Val["Validation<br/>reviews"]
    Val -->|PASS| Done([Done])
    Val -->|NEEDS_CHANGES<br/>feedback| Adj
    Val -->|BLOCK| Escalate([Escalate])
```

### Swarm

For applying the same kind of change across many files:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Lead["Lead partitions files<br/>into non-overlapping groups"] --> A1 & A2 & A3
    A1["Assimilation 1<br/><code>src/components/*.tsx</code>"]
    A2["Assimilation 2<br/><code>src/hooks/*.ts</code>"]
    A3["Assimilation 3<br/><code>src/utils/*.ts</code>"]
    A1 & A2 & A3 --> Review["Validation reviews<br/>aggregate changes"]
```

### Investigate

For understanding a codebase area before making changes:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Lead["Lead scopes investigation"] --> R1 & R2 & TA
    R1["Recon Adjunct A<br/>trace auth flow"]
    R2["Recon Adjunct B<br/>find all API endpoints"]
    TA["Tactical Analysis<br/>audit security posture"]
    R1 & R2 & TA -->|results linked to brain tasks| Synthesis["Synthesized findings<br/>returned to user"]
```

### Diagnose

For bugs with unclear root cause — adversarial hypothesis testing:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Lead["Lead frames competing hypotheses"] --> V1 & V2
    V1["Validation A<br/>tests hypothesis 1"]
    V2["Validation B<br/>tests hypothesis 2"]
    V1 & V2 -->|challenge each other| Converge["Converge on root cause"]
    Converge -->|--fix| Fix["Assimilation<br/>implements fix"]
```

### Architect (new)

For evaluating competing architectural approaches:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Lead["Lead frames approaches"] --> TA1 & TA2
    TA1["Tactical Analysis A<br/>evaluates approach 1"]
    TA2["Tactical Analysis B<br/>evaluates approach 2"]
    TA1 & TA2 -->|adversarial challenge| Winner["Winner selected"]
    Winner -->|--execute| Impl["Plan-execute mode<br/>implements winner"]
```

## Brain Integration

[Brain](https://github.com/benediktms/brain) is the persistence layer that enables coordination across agents and sessions. Unimatrix uses Brain for three core functions:

### Task Management

Brain tracks all work as tasks with dependencies, priorities, and status:

```
Epic: "Implement auth system"
├── Task 1: "Add JWT middleware" (ready)
├── Task 2: "Create login endpoint" (blocked by 1)
├── Task 3: "Add session store" (blocked by 1)
└── Task 4: "Integration tests" (blocked by 2, 3)
```

- The **lead session** creates epics and subtasks with dependencies via `tasks_apply_event`
- **Assimilation Adjuncts** mark tasks `in_progress`, add comments, and report completion
- `tasks_next` returns the highest-priority unblocked tasks
- `tasks_close` closes completed tasks and unblocks dependents

### Snapshots and Artifacts

Brain stores checkpoints and artifacts that enable context flow between agents:

| What | Who Creates | Purpose | Tags |
|------|-------------|---------|------|
| Adjunct checkpoints | Assimilation Adjunct | Pass context to subsequent waves | `drone-checkpoint`, `parent:<task-id>` |
| Implementation artifacts | Assimilation Adjunct | Permanent record of what changed | `drone-implementation` |
| Lead plans | Lead | Plan record before execution | `queen-plan` |
| Reconnaissance findings | Reconnaissance Adjunct | Recon results linked to tasks | `probe-recon` |
| Analysis reports | Tactical Analysis Adjunct | Structured analysis reports | `cortex-analysis` |
| Review verdicts | Validation Adjunct | Review verdicts and evidence | `vinculum-review` |

**Cross-wave context flow:** When adjuncts in Wave 1 complete, the lead extracts their snapshot IDs and passes them to Wave 2 adjuncts via `PRIOR CHECKPOINTS: <id1>, <id2>` in the prompt. This enables context handoff without the lead relaying full file contents.

### Memory

Brain's semantic memory enables knowledge persistence across sessions:

- `memory_write_episode` — Records structured episodes (goal, actions, outcome) with tags and importance
- `memory_search_minimal` — Semantic search with intent-aware ranking (lookup, planning, reflection, synthesis)
- `memory_expand` — Fetches full content from search stubs

## Hooks

Unimatrix hooks into platform event systems for automatic state management. Claude Code hooks are Python scripts in `src/hooks/claude/`. OpenCode hooks are TypeScript plugins in `src/hooks/opencode/`. Both implementations follow the shared logic defined in `src/hooks/SPEC.md`.

### State Tracking

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `track-agents.py` | SubagentStart/Stop | Tracks active subagents per session (type, duration, count) |
| `track-cost.py` | SubagentStop | Parses transcripts for token usage, calculates cost per agent tier |
| `track-compactions.py` | PreCompact | Counts context window compactions per session |

### Compaction Management

Claude Code compacts (summarizes) the conversation when the context window fills up. Unimatrix preserves critical state across compactions:

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `warn-compaction.py` | PostToolUse | Estimates token usage and warns at 70%/85% thresholds before compaction hits |

### Git Hooks

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `pre-commit` | Git pre-commit | Announces assimilation in progress |
| `post-commit` | Git post-commit | Re-runs `install.sh --both --global` to keep symlinks in sync after changes |

### Status Line

`src/shared/statusline.py` renders a custom Claude Code status line showing active agents (color-coded by type), elapsed durations, compaction count, and session cost.

## Coordination Patterns

### Parallel Execution

When plan steps are independent, multiple adjuncts run simultaneously:

- **File-partitioned:** Each adjunct gets a non-overlapping set of files. No worktree isolation needed — all commit directly to the current branch.
- **Worktree-isolated:** When adjuncts might touch overlapping files, each runs in an isolated git worktree. The lead squash-merges branches between waves.

### Sequential Execution

When steps have dependencies, adjuncts run one at a time. Prior checkpoint IDs flow forward via `PRIOR CHECKPOINTS:` in the prompt.

### Sequence Relay

For long sequential chains (3+ steps), each adjunct saves a handoff snapshot and the next adjunct receives only the handoff as prior context — avoiding lead session compaction in long chains.

### Mixed-Mode

Most real plans mix both: parallel foundation waves, sequential integration steps, parallel finishing work. The trimatrix graph engine computes optimal wave ordering automatically.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Wave1 ["Wave 1 — Parallel (foundation)"]
        A1["Assimilation 1"] & A2["Assimilation 2"] & A3["Assimilation 3"]
    end
    subgraph Wave2 ["Wave 2 — Sequential (integration)"]
        A4["Assimilation 4"] --> A5["Assimilation 5"]
    end
    subgraph Wave3 ["Wave 3 — Parallel (finishing)"]
        A6["Assimilation 6"] & A7["Assimilation 7"]
    end
    Wave1 -->|checkpoints| Wave2 -->|checkpoints| Wave3
```

### Error Handling

- If an adjunct fails, it marks the task `blocked` and reports to the lead
- The lead does not retry with the same approach — it escalates to the user
- If the Validation Adjunct finds critical issues, the lead dispatches new adjuncts with specific fix instructions

## Themes

Unimatrix ships 5 Borg-aesthetic TUI themes for OpenCode. Themes are installed to `~/.config/opencode/themes/` during global installation.

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `unimatrix` | Borg green-on-dark — the default collective aesthetic |
| `unimatrix-zero` | Soft dreamlike greens — Unimatrix Zero's subconscious drift |
| `queens-chamber` | Deep purple/violet — the Queen's sovereign aesthetic |
| `tactical-cube` | Aggressive red-shifted — crimson plasma of the combat cube |
| `unicomplex` | Gold/amber — the warm glow of the central hub |

To switch themes, edit `src/tui/tui.json` and change the `"theme"` value to any of the names above, then rebuild:

```bash
just build
# or install directly
./install.sh --opencode --global
```

## Configuration

### `settings.json`

Merged into Claude Code's settings during installation. Configures:

- **Hooks** — Maps Claude Code events to hook scripts (`SubagentStart/Stop`, `PreCompact`, `PostToolUse`)
- **Spinner verbs** — Custom Borg-themed loading messages
- **Status line** — Points to `statusline.py` for the custom status bar

### Agent Definitions

Each agent file (`src/agents/*.md`) uses combined YAML frontmatter with shared and platform-specific sections:

```yaml
---
model: sonnet
description: "Worker agent — implements a single well-defined task"

claude:
  name: Adjunct: Assimilation Protocol
  permissionMode: bypassPermissions
  disallowedTools: [Agent]
  maxTurns: 50

opencode:
  mode: subagent
  steps: 50
  permission:
    "*": allow
  tools:
    task: false
---
```

### Skill Definitions

Each skill file (`src/skills/*/SKILL.md`) uses YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: "Short description shown in /help"
user_invocable: true
---
```

The markdown body contains the full prompt that executes when the skill is invoked. Platform-specific dispatch syntax uses conditional sections (`<!-- @claude -->` / `<!-- @opencode -->`).
